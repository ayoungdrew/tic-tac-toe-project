### Technologies used
-Javascript
-jQuery
-CSS/SASS
-HTML
-Bootstrap framework

### Process
The project started from a wireframe and I used various notes from AJAX/API
training that we did in class as notes when setting up scripts for the project's
API calls.

Development started with game logic written in Javascript, followed by HTML
visuals to reflect the game functions. The latter stage involved working with
the API to nail down the correct AJAX requests - during this stage, I had to
revisit some of my game logic as it wasn't totally compatible with the API.

Some of the animations I wanted to be more robust but will have to spend more
time looking into the intricacies of jQuery and CSS to get to where I was
hoping to be. I'd also like to figure out a game mode to have a player play
against the computer.

### Development Materials
Some user stories I used as guides:
-As a user, I want to quickly start a game
-As a user, I want to have some sort of unique profile for this game
-As a user, I want to check the leaderboards to see how other users did
-As a user, I want to be able to restart the game quickly at anytime
-As a user, I want to be able to log in
-As a user, I want to be able to check my game history
-As a user, I want to be able to change my password
-As a user, I want to be able to log out
